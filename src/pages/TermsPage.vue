            <strong>Services Provided</strong><br>
            DocuShade facilitates medical consultations for the purpose of diagnosing conditions related to light sensitivity and issuing vehicle tint exemptions based on those diagnoses. DocuShade:
            <ul>
              <li>Connects clients with licensed physicians or nurse practitioners for diagnosis and medical documentation.</li>
              <li>Submits the necessary DMV-required forms for tint exemptions on behalf of the client.</li>
            </ul>
            DocuShade does not:
            <ul>
              <li>Provide any medical treatment or prescriptions. It is the client’s responsibility to seek further treatment if diagnosed with a condition.</li>
              <li>Offer any form of ongoing medical care. Our services are limited to diagnosis and documentation for the tint exemption process.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Client Responsibilities</strong><br>
            You agree to:
            <ul>
              <li>Provide truthful, current, and accurate information, including symptoms and other relevant details, during consultations.</li>
              <li>Respond promptly to any requests for additional information from healthcare providers.</li>
              <li>Understand that failing to provide accurate information may affect the outcome of your consultation or exemption request.</li>
            </ul>
            DocuShade will submit your tint exemption documents to the DMV on your behalf via mail. However, we cannot guarantee approval, as this decision rests solely with the DMV.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Medical Disclaimer</strong><br>
            All medical diagnoses are provided by licensed healthcare professionals. DocuShade does not provide medical treatment or prescriptions. If you are diagnosed with a medical condition through our Services, it is your responsibility to seek treatment from a licensed healthcare provider.
